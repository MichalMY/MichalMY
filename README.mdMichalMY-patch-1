#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int input;

    cout<<"3. Play multi-player\n";
    cout<<"4. Exit\n";
    cout<<"Selection: ";
    cin>>input;
    cout<<"\n";

    switch ( input )
    {
        case 1: //Note the colon, not a semicolon
            cout<<"Play game called";
            break;
        case 2:
            cout<<"Load game called";
